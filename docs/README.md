# `minesweeper-react`

An XP Minesweeper clone using React (for fun).

## Playing the Game

This game is built and distributed using Electron, meaning it can be installed as an
application on your computer. To do so, go to the [releases](https://github.com/twiertzema/minesweeper-react/releases)
section of the repo, choose a particular release, and download and run the relevant installer
from the **Assets** of that release.

## Roadmap

At the moment, this is just a pretty bare-bones recreation of the game. However, in the future,
I intend to split out the internal logic into a separate library that could be used to create
a Minesweeper clone in whatever front end framework you like - or no framework at all, if that's
your jam!

## API
